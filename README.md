Logic Gate
----------------------

Logic Gate plugin is a plugin that allows users to drag and drop logic gates onscreen and create a circuit that should match an output created by a lecturer:

Features

* A lecturer should be able to type a question into a text-box for the student to answer
* A lecturer should be able to assign an output to a question (ie the answer for the question)
* A lecturer should be able to choose a set selection of logic gates for the students to use in answering the question
* A student should be able to drag and drop logic gates onto the canvas
* A student should be able to connect logic gates via connecting wires
* The marker needs to be able to recognize the combination the student put down and compare it to the desired output that the lecturer assigned to the question
* The marker  needs to be able to give feedback to the student as to whether their output and the lecturers output matched by returning “correct” or “incorrect”
* A student should be able to answer in any order and to change their answer before submitting

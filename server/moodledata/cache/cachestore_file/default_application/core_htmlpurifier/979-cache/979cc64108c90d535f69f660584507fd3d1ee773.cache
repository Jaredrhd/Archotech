s:864:"<p>The page module enables a teacher to create a web page resource using the text editor. A page can display text, images, sound, video, web links and embedded code, such as Google maps.</p>

<p>Advantages of using the page module rather than the file module include the resource being more accessible (for example to users of mobile devices) and easier to update.</p>

<p>For large amounts of content, it's recommended that a book is used rather than a page.</p>

<p>A page may be used</p>

<ul>
<li>To present the terms and conditions of a course or a summary of the course syllabus</li>
<li>To embed several videos or sound files together with some explanatory text</li>
</ul>

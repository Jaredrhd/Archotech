s:1375:"<p>The database activity module enables participants to create, maintain and search a collection of entries (i.e. records).  The structure of the entries is defined by the teacher as a number of fields. Field types include checkbox, radio buttons, drop-down menu, text area, URL, picture and uploaded file.</p>

<p>The visual layout of information when listing, viewing or editing database entries may be controlled by database templates. Database activities may be shared between courses as presets and a teacher may also import and export database entries.</p>

<p>If the database auto-linking filter is enabled, any entries in a database will be automatically linked where the words or phrases appear within the course.</p>

<p>A teacher can allow comments on entries. Entries can also be rated by teachers or students (peer evaluation). Ratings can be aggregated to form a final grade which is recorded in the gradebook.</p>

<p>Database activities have many uses, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>A collaborative collection of web links, books, book reviews, journal references etc</li>
<li>For displaying student-created photos, posters, websites or poems for peer comment and review.</li>
</ul>
